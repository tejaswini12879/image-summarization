Computer Vision Project Summarizing Visual Data Using Bidirectional Similarity

Includes a bidirectional similarity measure between two images/videos of different sizes.

Described a principled approach to retargeting and summarization of visual data (images and videos) by optimizing this bidirectional similarity measure.

And the applications of this approach to image/video summarization, data completion and removal, image synthesis, image collage, photo reshuffling and auto-cropping.
